            features (dict[str,Tensor]): input data as a mapping from feature
                map name to tensor. Axis 0 represents the number of images `N` in
                the input data; axes 1-3 are channels, height, and width, which may
                vary between feature maps (e.g., if a feature pyramid is used).
            proposals (list[Instances]): length `N` list of `Instances`. The i-th
                `Instances` contains object proposals for the i-th input image,
                with fields "proposal_boxes" and "objectness_logits".
            targets (list[Instances], optional): length `N` list of `Instances`. The i-th
                `Instances` contains the ground-truth per-instance annotations
                for the i-th input image.  Specify `targets` during training only.
                It may have the following fields:

                - gt_boxes: the bounding box of each instance.
                - gt_classes: the label for each instance with a category ranging in [0, #class].
                - gt_masks: PolygonMasks or BitMasks, the ground-truth masks of each instance.
                - gt_keypoints: NxKx3, the groud-truth keypoints for each instance.

        Returns:
            list[Instances]: length `N` list of `Instances` containing the
            detected instances. Returned during inference only; may be [] during training.
